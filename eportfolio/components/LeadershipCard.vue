                   My role at OHB as the head of a brand new data &amp; analytics department was to bootstrap the organization's data governance from the ground up.
                   This included a greenfield data warehouse project, legacy system archiving and migration, and most importantly bolstering the company's data literacy.
                   As the lead data engineer and defacto head of data, I managed stakeholder requests across the organisation from cross-departmental collaboration for reporting all the way to strategic planning with the executive directors of the business.
                   On the ground floor, I managed the data warehouse project workflow including ideation &amp; planning, cost projections, resource and time management, agile scrum oversight, architectural design decisions and implementation.
                   I also managed SLAs and delegated adhoc reporting requests from multiple departments, establishing a ticketing system with lead times for specific adhoc data requests across Marketing, CRM, Warehouse, Customer Service and Merchandising departments.

                   During my time at CareerOne I had the privilege of running my own project as a Data Scientist developing a brand
                   new artificial intelligence system. Being the only resource in my immediate team with the expertise to 
                   develop the solution, I was tasked with scoping the solution and managing all project stakeholders by myself. 
                   I was able to hire an intern software engineer to work on the project alongside me, and I had the responsibility of
                   introducing that resource to the project and work alongside him. <br><br> 
                   
                   In order to successfully deliver the project, I managed the software developement lifecycle by accurately scoping user requirements, 
                   quantifying workloads and subsequently overseeing the progress of my team. This was an invaluable experience operating as a hands on product owner,
                   communicating progress reports to upper management and handling all aspects of human and technical resource management. My teammate 
                   and I successfully delivered the system in late 2019, and the system has been operating in production with no major failures
                   ever since on the CareerOne.com.au website.
